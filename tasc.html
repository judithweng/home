    <h1>TASC Voices</h1>

    <p> I spent my spring semester of 2022 at Tufts University for a 
        domestic exchange program. During my time there, I joined Tufts'
        Asian Student Coalition (TASC). Every spring semester, TASC 
        creates a collection of student art and writing, and publishes
        it in a magazine called Voices. This year's theme was "Body" and 
        it featured art surrounding our bodies and how we take care of it.

    <p> I was given the opportunity to be one of the designers for the 
        magazine. I never designed a magazine before, so I was both 
        nervous and excited for this project. I was able to choose
        the pieces of art I wanted to edit and design how to lay 
        them out in the magazine. The head design team carried out 
        a helpful tutorial and provided me with useful tips to 
        get started. I created several drafts because I was not sure
        how to present the pieces of art. However, after receiving 
        feedback from my peers, I was able to settle down on a design.

    <h2>Poster Design</h2>
    <p>
        A lot of members of TASC, including those who were not part of
        the magazine designing team, gathered together to create 
        a poster to put into our magazine. This was by far one of the 
        most chaotic but funniest moments of this project. Everyone 
        threw a bunch of ideas and tried to put everything together.
        Someone brought out a Q-tip and I suggested to put some gold 
        paper that was laying around to be used as the "ear wax" on 
        the Q-tip. Though I found this funny, I also thought that this 
        seemed something that carried a deep meaning: sometimes, the 
        things we hear are gold.

    <p><i>Special thank you to everyone at TASC for welcoming me and 
        embracing me. I would have never enjoyed my time at Tufts 
        without my TASC family.</i>
