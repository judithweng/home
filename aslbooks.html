    <h2>1. Translating</h2>
    <p>     For this project, I was tasked with translating children’s books, 
        <i>The Slant Book</i> and <i>Kevin’s Birthday Party</i>, from English to Spanish. 
        The main obstacle was figuring out the tone and translating the onomatopoeias. 
        For example, most Spanish speakers are not familiar with imperial units, but are 
        rather familiar with metric units. In The Slant Book, one of the lines includes 
        “ten feet high”. Due to what was previously stated, this was translated to 
        “tres metros de altura”, meaning “three meters high”. Moreover, onomatopoeias 
        do not have direct translations, or at least not as direct as other words. 
        I used a list of common onomatopoeias and comic books as references to what 
        is often used.

    <h2>2. Creating YouTube Videos</h2>
        <p>After translating the books, I edited existing videos of the books in 
            English and changed the lines to Spanish. I used iMovie and Premiere Pro 
            to edit the books. Videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSHDYWVXVg">The Slant Book</a> and 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ6nPdMsCoE">Kevin’s Birthday Party</a> are 
            available on YouTube. After the videos were uploaded, I added English captions 
            to them. The reason behind this is to make it accessible for those who want to 
            learn/read the book in both languages. If we added Spanish captions rather than 
            remaking the entire YouTube video, it could make the viewer feel excluded. 
            Therefore, it was decided to edit the videos and then add English captions.
