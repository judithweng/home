    <h2 id="intro">1. Motive</h2>
    <p> The main goal of this research is to develop a method to fit smooth functions
      onto data. For this project, the data of colormaps and 2D shapes were used.

    <h2 id="term">2. Rational Polynomials vs Rational Functions</h2>
      <p> Very often, people would use these two terms interchangeably. It is
        important to note, however, that they are different. Rational polynomials
        refer to any polynomial whose coefficient is a rational number. On the
        other hand, rational functions are a quotient of two polynomials. You
        can read more about rational functions

    <h2 id="lsf">3.Least Squares Fitting</h2>
      <p>It is a method used to find the best fitting function for a particular set of
      data points. It works by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. At a
      particular x point, the difference between the y values of the data point
      and the fitted function is called the residual.

      For n data points, each one can be represented as \((x_i,y_i)\) where
      \(i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n\).
      The residual function at a specific point is \(y_i - f(x_i)\),
      where \(f(x)\) is the fitted function.
      </p>

      <h2>3-1. Linear Fitting</h2>
      <p>
      To find the line of best fit, we need to find \(f(x)\) such that the sum of all
      residuals is the smallest, or in other words, minimize \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i))^2\).
      To achieve this, we must set the derivative of the sum equal to zero.

      The plotted function can be represented as \(f(x) = a + bx\),

      where \(b\) is:
      $$b = \frac{\sum_{}y_i(x_i-\overline{x})} {\sum_{}x_i(x_i-\overline{x})} $$

      and \(a\) is:
      $$a= \overline{y} - \overline{x}b$$

      \( \overline{x}\) and \( \overline{y } \) represent the mean of all \(x \) and \(y \) data values respectively.
