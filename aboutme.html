  <h1> About Me</h1>
  <p>Common questions people, even myself, ask me</p>


  <nav class="accordion arrows">
    <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="cb1" />
    <section class="box">
      <label class="box-title" for="cb1">Where am I from?</label>
      <label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label>
      <div class="box-content">
        The question “Where are you from?” never fails to make me sweat a bit. <br><br>
        Should I say New York? Or China? Or Colombia?<br><br>
        I would normally say I am from New York but originally from Colombia. 
        Sometimes it leaves one confused, so then I would clarify that I am 
        Chinese born in Colombia.
        There is no identity I strongly associate myself in, and it is also 
        not static. I often feel more Colombian than ever or more Chinese than 
        ever. Living with a mix of cultures from the far east and far west, 
        created a clash of self-identity within me. Colombia has a small 
        Chinese population, so I often caught the public eye whenever I went 
        out. Colombians often stared at me intensely because it was their 
        first time seeing an Asian person. I grew up ashamed of my Chinese 
        side. I refused to speak Chinese in public with my family and just wanted
        to wear sunglasses whenever I went out.  When I went to China, I felt left out. 
        I could not speak Chinese fluently and did not follow the customs. I was 
        now ashamed of my Colombian side. 
        In New York, I learned how to embrace my identity by witnessing all the diversity 
        around me. Even though my identity is still a blurry picture, I no longer 
        feel ashamed of who I am.
        <br><br>
        I am a proud Chinese Colombian living in New York.

    <section class="box">
      <label class="box-title" for="cb2">Why is my name four words long?</label>
      <label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label>
      <div class="box-content">Every time I need to fill out a document, go to the doctor 
        or even mail a package, I ask myself: what name should I write? <br><br>

        My full legal name is Judith Liping Weng Zhu. At a glance, people often think 
        that Judith is my first name and Zhu is my last name. This is 50% correct. 
        In English terms, Judith Liping is my first name and Weng Zhu is my last name. 
        In Colombia, and most of Latin America, every individual has two surnames, one from 
        their father and another from the mother. In my case, Weng is my father’s surname and Zhu 
        is my mom’s surname.<br><br>
        It is also very common for individuals to have a first and “second” name. This later 
        one is similar to what people in the U.S. call middle name. You might 
        have heard of names like Jose Luis, or Maria Camila. Colombians use their second names 
        more often and often do not associate themselves as just “Jose” or “Maria”. This might be why 
        in the U.S., Jose Luis is considered an individual’s first name, rather than Jose as their first and 
        Luis as their middle name. I fall within the minority group of Colombians who do not use their second 
        name at all. In fact, many of my friends do not know my second name, or should I say my first name?

    <section class="box">
      <label class="box-title" for="cb3">What language do I think in?</label>
      <label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label>
      <div class="box-content">This is perhaps the most intriguing question I get asked because I really 
        do not know the answer. I do believe that I used to have a ‘default’ language. When I first moved 
        to the U.S, everything I heard or read had to be translated into Spanish first in my mind for me 
        to understand it. If I was asked this question years ago, I would have said, without hesitation, 
        Spanish. However, I notice that this no longer happens, and I am not sure when this process stopped happening. <br><br>

        I have been thinking about this question for a long time and came up with a somewhat satisfying answer. 
        I believe that it depends on what topic the thought is about. If I am thinking about academic assignments 
        or work, it is often in English. This is because all the content I get taught or work with is in English. 
        Things related to family tend to be in Chinese, while things related to my childhood or my past tend to be 
        in Spanish. Now that I use all three languages often, it has become less clear which one my mind naturally chooses.
