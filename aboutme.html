  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <br><br>
  <p>My name is Judith and I am a Chinese Colombian engineer passionate about creating inclusive medical 
    technologies. I am currently working on imaging and computational models to better understand race and gender
    disparities in cardiovascular health. In the past, I have worked with electroencephalogram (EEG) and 
    x-ray computed tomography (CT). I have also led groups like Underrepresented Students
    in STEM and Society of Women Engineers to empower underrepresented individuals. During my free time,
    I enjoy upcycling clothes and going to the gym.
