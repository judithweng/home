    <h2>1. Background</h2>
    <p> Jorge Eli&eacute;cer Gait&aacute;n was a Colombian socialist, left-wing politician and supported by many Colombians.
        In 1948, he was assasinated during his second presidential campaign.
        The assasination, organized by the Colombian elites, sparked a period of violence and unrest, 
        known as <i>La Violencia</i>. Many leftists and revolutionary groups were formed to overthrow 
        the Colombian government. After a decade, with almost 200,000 deaths and the destruction of most 
        of the country, a peace settlement was reached between the right and left-wing parties. 
        Despite the settlement, many revolutionary groups continued
        to operate and are still active today.</p>
