    <h1>November</h1>

    <p> In the blink of an eye, it is already the end of november. I did not
        realize that I have not written a journal entry for a month. 
        I have been busy with grad school applications and senior thesis 
        stuff. Finals are around the corner and I am afraid I might be busier.
        I hope I get some time to wind down.
        <br><br>
        As someone born in South America, football (or as Americans call soccer) 
        has been a large part of my culture. I remember people around my 
        neighborhood would gather at my parents' restaurant and watch soccer 
        matches with bottles of beer and some food. Every time Colombia 
        scored, everyone would scream and all the cars would beep. The 
        excitement was off the roof. This is perhaps one of the things 
        I miss the most about my country. Regardless, it is still exciting 
        to be able to discuss about the World Cup with my Swarthmore friends 
        and predict scores.
        <br><br>
        This entry will be short and a self note that I will get through this 
        semester!
