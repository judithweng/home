    <h1>Welcome Blog!</h1>

    <p> Ever since I started to put together this website, I always thought
        of adding a 'blog' component to it. I have been hesitating all this 
        time because I thought that no one would read it and no one really 
        cares about what a 21-year old college girl is going through. These 
        may be true but I decided that I really wanted to document my growth 
        and my thoughts throughout my journey. 
        <br>
        I do keep a journal where I handwrite entries in Spanish once in a 
        while. This year, however, I have been traveling to different 
        states which has made it hard to carry items around me, which is 
        why I decided on this blog! I hope I can write to you every week 
        or every other week if my schedule gets a bit hectic.
    </p>

    <h2>Song of the week: Home by Janet Suhh</h2>
    <p><i>"After so much time has passed, another memory comes to my 
        mind; you were my home"
    </i></p>
    <p>Just to keep things a bit interesting, I will share a song that 
        will be stuck in my mind as I write these blogs. <br>
        Now that I am back home, it feels a bit weird but also a bit 
        relieving. I moved to a house earlier this year and I am not 
        used to living in a very quiet residential area of New York.
        I can't believe that I miss all the noise and crowd from 
        Chinatown.
