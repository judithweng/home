    <h1>Finding a path</h1>

    <p> Entering September has made me think a lot of how the year has
        just been moving forward and how can I move forward with it? 
        Sometimes I feel like I am stationary and not doing much. 
        I do not see much when I think of my future. I want to 
        continue learning so perhaps grad school but I also want
        to help my family financially so perhaps workforce. Time 
        really is flying but I just want to stop and take a break.

    <h2>Song of the week: Feel Good by Gryffin</h2>
    <p><i>"I doubt myself and I'm too proud to ask for help."
    </i></p>
    <p>I have no idea what I am doing that I get scared 
        to show that. I do not want to ask questions nor for help.
        What if doing that will make me feel inferior? 
        What if they think I am dumb?
