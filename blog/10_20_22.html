    <h1>Fellowship Apps!</h1>

    <p> This past month has felt extremely hectic because of class and also 
        grad school stuff. I have started to talk to potential advisors 
        for my career and have enjoyed all the talks. It makes me excited 
        to learn what these great professors are working on. 
        <br><br>
        A few days ago, I submitted my very first fellowship application! 
        It was definitely a lot of work and I am very thankful for all the 
        professors who helped me along the way and wrote recommendation 
        letters for me. This application allowed me to look back on my 
        past and realize how much growth there has been since the beginning 
        of college.
        <br><br>
        Last weekend I also went to a lantern festival. Never attended such 
        festival ever, but it was one of the most beautiful moments 
        I have witnessed in life. There were a lot of cars and a lot of people 
        which surprised me. There was a stage at the end of the field and 
        the stage host mentioned logistical details in between performances.
        He specifically mentioned that we cannot light our lanterns until the 
        fire patrol saids so. They need to analyze where the wind is blowing 
        and where most of the lanterns will end up in, so that they can set 
        themselves up in that area in case a fire is started. There were a 
        few people who, of course, did not listen. Everyone around them would 
        call them out or scream "booooo." I found this moment funny but also 
        comforting because it made me realize that a lot of people around me 
        care for everyone's safety. Every individual there took good care of 
        everyone around there. This is absolutely an event everyone should 
        experience.

    <h2>Song of the week: The Nights</h2>
    <p><i>"He said one day you'll leave this world behind, so live a life you 
        will remember."
    </i></p>
    <p>This was the song that started to play when I released my lantern. 
        This was a year where I certainly stepped out of my comfort zone. 
        I went to a new school for a semester and traveled to the west 
        coast for the first time. It was, without a doubt, amazing and 
        unforgettable.
