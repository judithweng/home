    <h1>Last First Day</h1>

    <p> A few days late to this journal but I just started my last fall
        semester as an undergraduate! It feels weird. I still feel like 
        a freshman! I have not been on campus for 9 months and I am 
        mostly seeing unfamiliar faces. I am excited for all of the classes 
        I will be taking this semester because I have finished all of my 
        prereqs and can finally take any classes I want. Hope I keep this 
        excitement all semester long! *fingers crossed*

    <p>This summer was, without a doubt, the best summer of my life. 
        I got to try so many new things and stepped out of my comfort 
        zone. I specifically became very social to the point some people 
        could not believe I was shy. This is for me, one of my biggest 
        accomplishments. I will forever cherish every individual I met 
        and all of the memories I created with them.
