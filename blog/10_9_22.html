    <h1>Half Way</h1>

    <p> Almost a month has passed since I last wrote here. 
        There is indeed a lot going on. I have talked to several 
        professors and counselors who have advised me and 
        encouraged me to apply to a PhD program. The past few weeks 
        I have been working on my application while at the same time 
        managing school work. This is perhaps one of the most 
        fun semesters I have had so far. Philosophy has been extremely 
        life changing and has made me become more aware of my surroundings. 
        Art has made me look at objects for an extremely long time, 
        which is tiring, but I have developed the ability to notice 
        the details of an object and their color value. My engineering 
        classes involve a lot of coding but they lead to material results 
        that you can see and feel. I have also somewhat chosen my senior 
        thesis. I still cannot believe I am a senior!

    <h2>Song of the week: This City (with Camilo)</h2>
    <p><i>"It scares me when I stop dead and see how fast time has passed"
    </i></p>
    <p>It is already fall break. A mark that shows we are half way 
        through the semester. There is a lot that I want to do with my 
        friends and classmates. It scares me that we might not see 
        each other again once we graduate, which is why I just want 
        to stay right here and right now forever.
