    <h2>1. Pattern Design</h2>
    <p>This was, undoubtedly, the hardest pattern to create. It consisted of mostly 
        curves and there were a few lines. Fusion has made it easy to trace a pattern,
        so for the shoes, I traced the pattern of the smallest size possible and 
        used the scale function. This is different from how the other patterns were coded,
        which used the location of points or dimensions of the lines. 
      <BR>
        Two documents were made for this pattern. One contained the patterns 
        needed for the outer material, and the other for the fusible.

      <p>Due to time constraints, I was not able to laser cut and create the shoes.
          Regardless, this pattern was worth coding because it contained a lot of complex
          lines.
