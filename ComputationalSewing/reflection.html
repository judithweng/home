    <p>Fast fashion has dominated the fashion industry. The highly competitive market 
      constantly refreshes their products to encourage customers to buy more. This leads 
      to clothes with a short life cycle, in which many end in landfills. As society grows 
      more conscious, many have started to thrift and upcycle clothes. This, however, is not 
      a skill that everyone has. Not everyone is able to create a piece of clothing, since it 
      requires a lot of time and effort. What if there was a program that could create clothing 
      and tailor it for you? This became my main motivation for this project. <br><br>

      I was among those who did not know how to sew. Therefore, I spent some time getting to 
      know the sewing machine. I made several small items, such as a shirt and several pouches. 
      I made these using free patterns online. It was extremely time consuming and often tricky. 
      This is where computational sewing plays an important role.<br><br>
      
      I decided to use Autodesk Fusion 360 to create pattern designs. With Fusion, I was able 
      to create designs through Python code. I first coded a simple pencil pouch pattern, which 
      consisted of only rectangles. I also coded a window that would allow users to input the 
      dimensions of the pouch they wanted to create. This later part was the most difficult 
      since not much code documentation was available for me to follow. After coding the 
      program, I exported the file so that it could be used in the laser cutter. Cutting the 
      fabric took less than 30 seconds, and the edges were cut much cleaner than if they were 
      cut by hand. <br><br>
      
      Similarly, I coded a few more pattern designs where each one increased in complexity 
      and difficulty: a tote bag, a crop top, a shirt, and shoes. Calculating the dimensions 
      of these pieces was often hard, so I used CLO3D, a cloth modeling software, whenever 
      I wanted to check my work. Fusion 360, unfortunately, did not have features that could 
      model fabric drape. This meant that I was not able to check how the cloth pieces would 
      look since they would look like stiff materials. With CLO3D, however, I was able to 
      even import an avatar and change the avatarâ€™s dimensions. This was extremely helpful 
      since this meant I would not have to find a model, get their dimensions, create a 
      customized piece for them and check if the calculations were done correctly. <br><br>
      
      This past summer, I was able to combine my knowledge in engineering with my interests 
      in environmentalism and social good. Throughout this project, I have realized that 
      change within the fashion industry can be made. Producing clothes should not create 
      harm to any human or environment. I hope to continue exploring this field and contribute 
      to a change in fashion at an industrial and individual level.<BR><BR>
      
      I would like to thank the Panaphil Foundation and Frances Velay for this opportunity, 
      Professor Ganapati for her mentorship, and Jackie from the MakerSpace for her 
      technical assistance. <Br>
