    <h1>Making a Crop Top</h1>
    <p><i>(The following is not a tutorial but a reflection of my results. Click
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JqDKbodHD4">here</a>
    to access the tutorial and pattern used.)</i> </p>

    <h2>1. Pattern Design</h2>
    <p>The pattern of the crop top consisted in straight lines and curves.
        I drew one half of the top and then mirrored it to complete the top.
        I selected key points on each line and then determined a path for each point
        given a size input.

    <h2>2. Autodesk Fusion Code and CLO3D</h2>
    <p>
     The curves of the top were made using the spline built in function in Fusion.
     I also used the canvas feature to import the pdf pattern so that it is easier
     to sketch the pattern onto fusion. <br>
     After coding the pattern, I tested it using CLO3D. I was able to create an avatar
     with the dimensions I wanted and made a crop top for those dimensions. This software
     was useful to test out different sizes without actually making them in real life.

    <h2>3. Custom Crop Top</h2>
    <p>
      I decided to make a top for myself, 
      </p>

      <p>
        I used an old shirt that had painted lettering. This made it slightly difficult
        to fold the fabric, which led to slighlty uneven sleeves. In addition,
        there is a slight indent in the neck when it starts to curve. I have seen 
        in other tutorials that one should normally cut the fabric to release tension.
        This step was not shown in the tutorial but it should be important to do.
    </p>

        </figure>
      <p>
      The calculations of the top were pretty accurate. One downside is that a lot of time
      was spent picking points and calculating how they change. One way to improve this might
      be making Fusion select the key points rather than manually selecting them.
