    <h1>Thread Tension</h1>
    <p>The thread of the machine can be loosened or tightened using this
    feature. For this model, it is a dial located at the top of the sewing machine.
    The tension can range from 0 to 9. The higher the number, the higher the tension.

    <p> Normally the tension is adjusted at 4, but you should always test the
      setting before sewing your piece. One thing you can do is use different thread
      colors for the needle and bobbin. The tension would need to be adjusted if
      two colors of thread are clearly visible. </p>
    <p> The image below shows different tension adjustments: 1, 3, 6 and 8.</p>

    <p>We can see that the bobbin thread can be seen in the last two stitches.
      This is because the tension is too high and should be adjusted to a lower tension.</p>
