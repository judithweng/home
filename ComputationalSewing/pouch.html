    <h1>Coding a Pouch Pattern</h1>


    <h2>1. Pattern of Pouch</h2>
    <p>The pattern of the pouch is based on <a href=
      'https://noodle-head.com/2012/06/open-wide-zippered-pouch-tutorial-size.html'>
     noodlehead's tutorial </a> and is very simple. It consists of four rectangles
      of the same size. Two of them are used for the exterior and the other two for the lining.
      <br><br>
       To prevent confusion, I will be referring to the dimensions of the pouch as
      height, width, and depth--x,y, and z respectively-- while the dimensions
      of the pattern, length and width, will be L and W.
      <br><br>
      Intuitively, I noticed that L, length of pattern, depends on height and depth, x and z, but not on width, y;
      and W, the width, depends on width and depth, y and z, but not height, x.
      This may not be 100% correct but serves the purposes with the numbers that I will be working with.
      From this, I can write the following function
      </p>
      $$L(x,z) = ax + bz$$
      $$W(y,z) = cy + dz$$
      <p> where a, b, c and d are constants. These can be put in matrix form and using the dimensions
        given in noodlehead's site, we can find the coefficients and then use this equation to create pouch patterns.

        $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
        7 \\ 9 \\ 11 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        4.5 & 3.5 \\
        6 & 4  \\
        8.5 & 4.5 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        a \\ b \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        $$
        \begin{bmatrix}
        10 \\ 12 \\ 14 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
        5 & 3.5 \\
        6.5 & 4  \\
        8 & 4.5 \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        c \\ d \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        I used MATLAB to solve for the coefficients (download MATLAB file <a href='patterncalc.mlx'>here</a>)
        and arrived to the following equations.
        $$L(x,z) = 0.6847x + 1.1669z$$
        $$W(y,z) = 0.7273y + 1.8182z$$


      </p>

      <h2>2. Fusion 360's API</h2>
      <p>Autodesk Fusion is a design and modeling software. As read in the title,
      Fusion has an application programing interface (API). This allows users to
      access the features of the software through code. The language used for this project
      was python. Even though Fusion has its own built in function to obtain user inputs,
      I used tkinter library for the sake of simplicity. (Download the code
      <a href="C:\Users\judit\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts\pouch3\pouch3.py">here</a>) </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="pouch/window.PNG" >
        <figcaption><i>When the code is run, a window pops up asking the user for three
           inputs: <br>length, width, and depth of pouch</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="pouch/inputs.PNG" >
        <figcaption><i>For example, if the user enters the dimensions of a small pouch</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="pouch/pattern.PNG" >
        <figcaption><i>Then Fusion will draw the pattern of a small pouch from our reference</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <img src="pouch/check.PNG" >
        <figcaption><i>To check, click on a side of the rectangle and you should see its length
        in the lower right corner.<br>As an alternative, use Inspect > Measure (as shown above) to check
        the dimensions of the pattern</i></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <br><br>
      <p>In the images above, the dimensions inputted were that of the small pouch.
        It resulted in a rectangular pattern with dimensions of 7.222 inches by 10.079 inches.
        This is very close to the pattern that was suggested, 7 inches by 10 inches. Similarly,
        all other sizes obtained similar results.</p>

      <h2>3. Next Steps</h2>
      <p>
        -Laser cut the pattern created in Fusion, sew it and see if it matches the dimensions inputed<br>
        -Allow users to choose between standard and customizable sizes<br>
        -Branch out to other patterns, specifically those with non-rectangular shapes
       </p>
