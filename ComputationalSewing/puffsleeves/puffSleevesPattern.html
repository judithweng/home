    <h2>1. Pattern Design</h2>
    <p>The pattern design was similar to that of a tote bag. It consisted of mostly
         straight lines. It only had curves around the neck area and waist.

    <h2>2. Upcycling</h2>
    <p>
     I used an old men's button up shirt to create this piece of cloth. 
     The buttons were removed and the pattern was cut. The pieces were put
     together as instructed. The main difference between this and the previous
     works, is the inclusion of elastic bands. This made the work a lot more
     customizable since the elastic band allowed to fit a range of measurements.
